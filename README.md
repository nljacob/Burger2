Burger is a restaurant app that lets users input the names of burgers they'd like to eat and then choose to "devour" them. When a user submits the name of a burger, it will display the burger on the left side of the page and once they click on the "devour" button, the burger moves to the right side of the page. Every burger that is added is stored in a database. 

This app is a full-stack application that uses CSS, JavaScript, Node, Express, MySQL, ORM, and Handlebars.
